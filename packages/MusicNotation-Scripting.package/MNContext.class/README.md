I am a context for an MNEvironment and I am used to add MNNotes to a MNProject through the scripting API. 
Therefore, an MNNoteBuilder gives me a built MNNote and I add it to an MNProject. Also, I create an MNNoteStatement from it that can be used for further script evaluation.

Instance Variables
	project:		MNProject

project
	- This is the MNProject I add MNNotes to.
