I am a context for a MNEvironment and I am used to add MNNotes to a MNProject through the scripting API. 
Therefore, a MNNoteBuilder gives me a builded MNNote and I add it to a MNProject. Also, I create a MNNoteStatement from it that can be used for further script evaluation.

Instance Variables
	project:		MNProject

project
	- This is the MNProject I add MNNotes to.
