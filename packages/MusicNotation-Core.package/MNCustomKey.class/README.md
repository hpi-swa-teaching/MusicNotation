I am a custom key without any specific rules how I should be. I can store any accidentals needed for the key. I am a subclass of MNKey.

Instance Variables
	accidentals:		OrderedCollection of Associations (Character -> Integer).

accidentals
	- These are the accidentals I provide. The step (Character) is the position and the alter (Integer) is how much this position is altered (range -2 to 2).
