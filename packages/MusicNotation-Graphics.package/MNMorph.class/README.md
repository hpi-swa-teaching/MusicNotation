I am an MNMorph that supports MNFlexLayout. I have some other useful properties used to display MNMusicObjects.

Instance Variables
	font:		MNFont
	scale:		Float

font
	- This is the font that provides SVG paths for the MNMusicObjects that I should display.

scale
	- This is a factor that scales the MNMusicObject I display.
